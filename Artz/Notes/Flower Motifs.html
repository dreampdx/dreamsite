			<p class="chris"> I am beginning work on learning to draw and sketch, studying from a book entitled <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3532085-experiential-drawing">Experiental Drawing</a> that I'd picked up from having been at the Sacramento art museum. The book immediately spoke to me, as experiential is a word indicative of many of my favorite concepts. I've attempted to work thru it before, and am attempting again, now. From what I remember, the introduction was inspirational regarding the uptake of any art, and I feel it is a welcome addition to the Palace.</p>

			<p class="chris"> From the book: "When we experience drawing as a process of seeing and not as an attempt to reproduce reality, we express our personal creative vision authentically and effortlessly."</p>

			<p class="chris"> "Experiential drawing focuses on careful observation and personal discovery rather than on technical rules." [...] "Since [it] emphasizes the experience of drawing, the resulting images become less important. The drawings that result are the evidence of that process." </p>

			<p class="chris"> "When we put our attention on our creative experience–the seeing, discovering, feeling process–then learning is fast. The more we learn, the more exciting the creative experience becomes. As the learning process and the creative experience reinforce each other, the resulting drawing will become richer."</p>

			<p class="chris"> I think this is just a beautiful model of artistry. It captures something that I find most vividly in my own life in my having self-taught the playing of piano. Furthering my ability to recreate my experience musically is the name of the game, it is the experience of the playing that I am after, rather than the outcome. </p>

			<p class="chris"> "There is only one time and one place that experience can occur. That is here and now. To be competent we must be attentive to what is happening here and now."" </p>

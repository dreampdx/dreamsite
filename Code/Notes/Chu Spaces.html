			<p class="chris"> From the article "Chu Spaces: Automata with quantum aspects", Pratt, Vaughan, 1994. Jake sent me this article to read, so I'm beginning here. </p>
			
			<p class="boxed"> "Chu Spaces are a recently developed model of concurrent computation extending automata theory to express branching time and true concurrency. They exhibit in a primitive form the quantum mechanical phenomena of complementarity and uncertainty." [...] "There is an intensive ongoing search for an attractive framework that can be applied reliably to the modeling of computational behavior in the same general way that vector spaces are heavily used today as a basis for computational geometry and computer graphics. Chu spaces are our current favorite contender for this role." </p>

			<p class="chris"> This seems like a great next topic for me, as a way to further my study of the theories of automata and computation, synthesized. I find this idea fascinating, that there might exist a domain in which computational behavior can be modeled and synthesized just as such is done with physical behavior in a vector space... And that these spaces exhibit branching behaviors is of great interest, because immediately I'm thinking of narrative scenarios, and using these to model them. But let me not get ahead of myself. </p>

			<p class="boxed"> "It seems to us that Chu spaces have the potential to continue this progress, not merely a long way but all the way. Our thesis is that the category Set is the ultimate abstraction of body, and that Set^op, equivalent to the category of complete atomic Boolean algebras (i.e. power sets), which we shall advocate thinking of as antisets, is dually the ultimate abstraction of mind. A Chu space over a set K is simply a K-valued binary relation from a set to an antiset. We submit as circumstantial evidence for this thesis the above-mentioned universality of Chu spaces. The thesis can be contradicted by improving on Set (and hence Set^op) in a suitable way. We are not presently aware of a more appropriate basis for the Chu construction than Set, and until one appears we shall stick to our thesis." </p>

			<p class="chris"> This is good applicatory knowledge for me to soon take to the wikipedia definition of a chu space. I like that I can ground this concept in something first, beforehand. So, it seems to me that this paper is referencing this specific chu space, that between Category Set and Category Set^Op, which is classic category theory. It is simply a K-valued binary relation from set to antiset, huh? I'm excited to learn about what exactly a chu space is, so as to fill in this new concept. </p>

			<p class="chris"> I am now moving to reading off of the wikipedia article on chu spaces. </p>

			<p class="boxed"> "Chu spaces generalize the notion of topological space by dropping the requirements that the set of open sets be closed under union and finite intersection, that the open sets be extensional, and that the membership predicate (of points in open sets) be two-values. The definition of continuous function remains unchanged other than having to be worded carefully to continue to make sense after these generalizations." [...] "Understood statically, a Chu space (A, r, X) over a set K consists of a set A of points, a set X of states, and a function r : A x X -> K. This makes it an A x X matrix with entries drawn from K, or equivalently a K-valued binary relation between A and X (ordinary binary relations being 2-valued)." </p> 

			<p class="chris"> To fully grasp this material, I will have to brush up once more on topological spaces, although I am understanding some of it. It is just a matrix whose rows are indexed by points in A, whose columns are indexed by states in X, and whose values are given by the function r, which returns values from set K. It is then a space created that utilizes two separate domains in which to transition... rather than the transition taking information from only one domain, as it does in normal automata. I am interested in further reading these materials to see where the state machines come into play over a Chu space. </p>

			<p class="chris"> I found a subsection in this wikipedia article on Chu spaces about how they relate to automata, and lo and behold, that paragraph was from the article Jake had sent me! So, I return to that article now, to learn more about this intersection of Chu spaces and automata... </p>

			<p class="boxed"> Vector spaces are defined b first fixing an arbitrary field k, which then determines the category of vector spaces over k and their operators (linear transformations). Chu spaces are similarly defined by first fixing merely an arbitray set K. A chu space A = (A, X, r) over K consists of sets A and X and a function r: X x A -> K. The bianry application r(x, a) may alternatively be written as x r a and pronounced "x satisfies a", or reversed and pronounced "a holds in x". The dual of (A, X, r), written as (A, X, r)^T, is simply its transpose (X, A, r), itself a Chu space."

			<p class="chris"> New verbage relating to the definition of a Chu space. That I'm now armed with a little intuitive language is really nice, like how "a holds in x" and how "x satisfies a", that's good. A being points, and X being states, this means that the state satisfies the position, and that the position holds in such state... interesting. Thus, the set of points is the set and body, the set of states is the antiset and mind, so the mind satisfies the body, and the body holds in the mind. Not that this is meaningful directly, but that it is scaffolding for a soon-to-come more formal understanding.</p> 

			<p class="boxed"> "In the declarative view, each a in A is an atomic proposition or propositional variable, and x r a gives the truth value of that proposition in state x, as an element of K. Propositional Boolean logic obtains for K = 2, where a proposition is either true or false in any given state. A normal Chu space may then be understood as an (abstract) Boolean proposition p(A) expressible with the variables of A. Each property is determined by those missing rows of A that are resotred, whence A ust have exactly 2^(2^A - X) properties."</p>

			<p class="chris"> This is perfect, this is the machine I was referencing wanting to get my hands on. So, if a is a propositional, some expression, and it is evaluable over items in X, then the output is some K that will fill in this matrix. So, perhaps a cellular automata would look like, some proposition a which is the ruleset, over some state x, which is the number of neighbors, and K is thusly the output, the "truth state", which in cellular automata's case would be the state the automata is set to next iteration.</p>

			<p class="chris"> The article continues onto material that is deeply over my head, so I'll end my notetaking here. </p>
